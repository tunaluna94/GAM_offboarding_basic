# GAM_offboarding_basic
Public use GAM offboarding script

Prior to using this script I have assumed you have already setup GAM in your enviroment, if you have not please visit https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM/wiki to get setup.

Also before running the command please ensure your oauth token is not expired, you can run the "gam oauth create" command to generate a new one.
